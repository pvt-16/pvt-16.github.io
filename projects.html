	<ul>
		<li>
			<h2>Data Analysis with Avanti West Coast train service</h2>
			<p>Led the project team, performed statistical analysis, visualization
				and reporting to assess the impact of weather conditions on railway performance from 2020 to 2021. Identified
				worst-affected routes and dates with average 20% delay to conclude a lack of relationship.<a href="#">Github</a></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Reinforcement Learning for Space trajectory optimization</h2>
			<p>Trained an RL agent in Lunar Lander environment using
				Q-learning methods. Achieved reward of 60 points over only 30 training runs for DQN agent after hyperparameter tuning
				for epsilon decay and learning rates<a href="#">Github</a></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Project 3</h2>
			<p>Assessed over 10,000 Amazon reviews using Tf-Idf and Naive Bayes binary classifier to obtain
			 82% accuracy. Identified 30 books with 3.5+/5 ratings but negative comments<a href="#">Github</a></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Sketch2Face and Face2Sketch</h2>
			<p>Building multiple autoencoders (Basic, Variational, Convolutional) and GANs using Keras and TensorFlow to generate
				sketches from colour images and vice-versa. Achieved around 78% accuracy with a VGG-16 architecture based model.<a href="#">Github</a></p>
